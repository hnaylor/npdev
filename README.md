Git for Content -- Amanda
Need alternative to Google Docs for collaborative writing
Who doesn't use it and why
Storing as text and outputting in some other format.
git - open protocol, language for managing changes to repository
github.com - a commercial site for hosting repositories
possibile to sync repositories without a hub but easier to use a hub
markdown -- a language for managing content, like HTML or LATEX
priatepad.net/npdev -- links and illustration of use to start the process of writing
Github makes some GUI available
Mostly command line
Compare versions to see major text changes. Branches retain a snapshot of past / ended projects. 
Fork vs Branch
A fork is another repository. Separate. Taking something that exists (someone elses) and using as your starting point. It's public, open, and when you fork it you control it.
A branch is your own stuff. 
Github gives a nice overview of versions by comparisons (can also use git diff at cmd line). 
blogging tool = jekell
desktop git maybe difficult... 
Locally Commit, last step is Push to repository on github. 
    - so the Commits stay local
    - start work by Pull from repository
    - do not work on same content at same time (or split into 2 files)
    - Amanda thinks that git will flag collisions
    - Git tracks changes on a line basis not paragraph.
